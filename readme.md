## MVP

Starting this project, I built a simple game that had moving sprites. Going from there, my next set of goals included:
- a hero that could collect currency (rupees)
- an enemy that hurt the hero
- a live heart bar that had a lose condition
- a basic high-scores screen
- starting and ending screens

**Currently in progress:**
- multiple enemies
- pregressively harder levels and cut-scenes
- new items added to each level
- an accurate system of item effects and updated npc interactions
